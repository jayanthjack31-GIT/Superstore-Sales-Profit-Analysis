# Superstore-Sales-Profit-Analysis

 Built an interactive Sales & Profit dashboard by extracting and modeling data from PostgreSQL into Power BI, uncovering
 key insights such as $2.3M total sales, $286K profit, and 47% contribution from the Consumer segment. Identified the
 Technology category as the top-performing segment and revealed that the West region drove the highest profitability and
 returns. Analyzed multi-year trends (2011–2015) to highlight seasonal sales spikes and support data-driven decision-making


📊 Superstore Data Analysis using SQL

📈 7. Key Insights (Optional to Include)

The highest sales come from Consumer segment and West region.

Categories like Technology generate strong revenue but profit varies by sub-category.

Some products consistently show negative profit, indicating discount/leverage issues.

Returned orders heavily depend on region—useful for risk and logistics analysis.

🧩 8. How to Use This Repository
